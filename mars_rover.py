This is a game to explore Mars.

Mars is represented in an nxn grid/matrix. At some coordiates (x,y), where x,y is {0,n-1}; 
there are some special sites for exploration. 

The main character is a rover that can:
1. move A units in 4 directions
2. explore and find out whether the destination is an exploration site


Rules:
1. An exploration site becomes a regular site after the rover explores it.
2. the rover has limited fuel, and the game ends when it runs out
3. the game also ends if the rover just gives up triggered by QUIT command at anytime
